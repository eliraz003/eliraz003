### 🎨 Figma Grid / Layout Maker Plugin (easy)grid  🎨
`JavaScript`<br>
A plugin built for the Figma design software that allowes the user to select a layer and configure a layout (by selecting columns, rows, and spacing) and then applying it to the layer with a click on a button. This plugin makes creating layouts much faster and can allow for complicated / unique layouts thanks to the merger functionallity (drag multiple cells in preview together)

> I am still in the process of creating a .README for this project, however there still is one that describes the basics. Feel free to explore around the codebase to provide contributions or to fork the project and make it your own!
